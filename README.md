# TinyTorch: PyTorch-inspired Neural Networks from Scratch with NumPy ðŸ§ ðŸ”¢

TinyTorch is a lightweight neural network framework built from scratch using only NumPy. Inspired by the design philosophy and modularity of PyTorch, this project aims to demystify the inner workings of deep learning frameworks.

## ðŸš€ Features

- PyTorch-like API (e.g., `Module`, `Sequential`, etc.)
- Forward and backward propagation from scratch
- Custom loss functions and optimizers
- Basic autograd engine (if implemented)
- Fully connected layers, activation functions, and more

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Python 3
- NumPy only (no external ML libraries)
